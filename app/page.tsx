                      Its market is two-sided. The stablecoin market is the largest capital market in crypto outside of the winning layer 1 monies (BTC & ETH). Probably ~10% of the total crypto market, which if it grows could be 100s of trillions in size, thus 10T+ to stablecoins. My prediction is that decentralized stablecoins will hit an inflection point of adoption and overtake centralized fiat-backed stables, therefore being the top players in the stablecoin market.
                      On the other hand we have the market for credit and margin whose demand will bootstrap $CDT supply during the bull market. Exact market size I'm unsure of, but also many billions of dollars and could grow to be much higher.

                        Yes, as a decentralized stable its value prop will be made apparent anytime there are fiat-based insolvencies or censorship activities.

                      It allows liquidations to be spread across collateral types instead of each liquidation only converting a single asset type. This means the market of each collateral asset will be pressured less from $CDT liquidations in a down cycle.
                      <br />
                      It allows users to collateralize their whole portfolio & therefore getting the benefits of assumingly diversified volatility profiles. As well as allowing users to recapitalize their position with any available collateral types rather than just the initial deposit.

                      <p className="text-wrapper-2">
                      The primary difference is the lack of a PSM, which allows for 1:1 swaps with fiat-backed tokens. This is great to keep the peg fixed (a hard peg) by having an instantaneous arb cycle. The problem with this is that it pegs the stable to the PSM's accepted assets instead of to the desired USD denomination. When USDC depegs, so does DAI & IST.
                      <br />
                      The liquidation pools are another major differentiation by making liquidated collateral available to the entire market instead of just the user who calls the liquidation. This allows a wider distribution of assets, in turn decreasing the effect of $CDT liquidations on the market. This and liquidation diversity from bundles make $CDT a partner of market stability during a down cycle.

                      There is potential that a floating peg requires less/softer pressure because it is liquidating all assets and it isn't merely a $USDC wrapper. If $DAI risks are at best the same as $USDC, many regulators may ask why DDAI risk is necessary, compared to $CDT, which is actively derisking its fiat-backed collateral types.

                      $CDT will be a de-facto medium of exchange and stable store of value in the IBC-connected Cosmos, while the value faucets in the protocol (delegations, LPs, redemptions) will have attracted a network of aligned participants. The POL generated from liquidations will continue to build a long term bed of liquidity for $CDT. Majority of content creation will come from the community as a way to narrate ongoing history & attract new members.

                        For a user, leverage is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor that leaks its risk to the wider market. In a bullish environment, the more levered the overall market, the harder it'll crash on an inevitable downturn. As a cog in the leverage machine, it's Membrane's responsibility to reduce the overall effect its deleveraging has on the ecosystem overall. Deleveraging is destruction that must be reintegrated into the environment to act as nutrients in the next phase of the cycle.

                        The usual method is having a single liquidator's preference determine the outcome for the liquidated collateral, normally selling via DEX. This not only centralizes the discount from said collateral but also lubricates the mountains for a liquidation cascade, which can snowball and liquidate everything in its path.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Membrane's liquidation dispersion method is 2-fold. Initially because positions can hold multiple collateral types, each liquidation is more likely to liquidate multiple assets instead of having to recapitalize 100% of the debt from a single market. Next, these assets go through liquidation pools so that each is distributed to every bidder in a pool, which if empty will go to a secondary pool that is FIFO to encourage competitive refills. Distributing to more people means there will be more collateral that doesn't get sold right away (instead it is staked, LP'd, held) which will (1) Give the market temporary strength, and (2) Allow long term holders to obtain assets at discounted prices.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Overall, this makes $CDT liquidations a redistribution method from high-risk to lower risk which in turn strengthens the foundation of each collateral's market distribution.
